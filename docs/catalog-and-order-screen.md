# Catalog & Order Screen Updates

This release refreshes the ordering workflow and adds an in-app catalog manager.

## Order screen

- The right-hand order panel is taller so at least four line items remain visible on a
  1366×768 display without scrolling.
- The application now opens maximised by default to make better use of available space.
- PlayStation controls continue to appear on the left, while totals and payment actions
  stay anchored at the bottom of the screen.

## Managing the catalog

- Admins can open **إدارة الأصناف (مدير)** to launch the new catalog manager dialog.
- The left list shows all categories. Use **إضافة…**, **تعديل…**, or **حذف** to manage
  sections. The **⬆ أعلى** and **⬇ أسفل** buttons persist the display order.
- Selecting a category loads its products on the right. Products can be added, edited,
  deleted, or reordered without leaving the dialog. Stock tracking and minimum alerts
  are configurable per item.
- Changes are applied immediately and broadcast through the app, so open order screens
  refresh automatically.

New installations start with an empty catalog. Administrators can populate sections and
products directly from the dialog without editing the database manually.
